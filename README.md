The NHANES is a study program designed to assess the nutritional status of adults and children in the United States, conducted annually. NHANES interviews include demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. In this Jupyter notebook, we will analyze data collected from a national sample of individuals during the 2015-2016 cycle.

## Statistical analyses performed:
* Descriptive statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, quartiles)
* Stratified proportions by gender and ethnic origin
* Histograms and box plots
* Inferential statistical analyses (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests)
* Linear model regressions and marginal models
